# SpotifyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Important

1) First, you need to install the dependencies mentionated in scripts/spotifyKey.js
For this, you'll have to run the following:
npm install isomorphic-fetch
npm install btoa
npm install path
npm install fs

2) After this, you'll need to run the spotifyToken script, so:

npm run getSpotifyToken

This auto-generated code expires every couple of hours. If you see that you app is not making the call, please re-run it.

This script for the API token was made by the ng-book guys. I want to thank them for this, their code really helped me with this project. Also, my colleague Valentin.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
